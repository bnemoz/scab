installation
============

The easiest way to install scab is to use pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install scab

| 

If you don't have pip, the Anaconda_ Python distribution contains pip along 
with a ton of useful scientific Python packages and is a great way to get 
started with Python.  

Stable_ and development_ versions of scab can also be downloaded from Github. 
You can manually install the latest development version of scab with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/briney/scab
    $ cd scab/
    $ git checkout development
    $ python setup.py install
