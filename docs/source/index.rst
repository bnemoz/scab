scab: single cell analysis of B cells
===================================================================
 
scab provides a computational framework for integrating, analyzing and 
visualizing single B cell multi-omics data. We have developed a simple, 
straightforward API (which will feel quite familiar to users of scanpy_) that 
allows sophisticated analyses with just a few lines of code:

scab is a standards-based toolkit built on the ``AnnData`` objects used 
by scanpy_. We integrate several tools specifically designed to facilitate 
analysis of adaptive immune cells and repertoires.
