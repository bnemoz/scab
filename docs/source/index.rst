scab: single cell analysis of B cells
===================================================================

scab is a core component of the ab[x] toolkit for antibody sequence analysis. 
scab provides a computational framework for integrating, analyzing and 
visualizing single B cell multi-omics data. We have developed a simple, 
straightforward API (which will be quite familiar to users of scanpy_) that 
allows sophisticated analyses with just a few lines of code:
